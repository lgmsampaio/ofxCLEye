Wrapper for the [CL Eye Platform SDK](http://codelaboratories.com/products/eye/sdk/), necessary to control the PlayStation Eye camera. This addon was inspired by the version from [Wouter R.](https://github.com/woutgg/ofxCLeye), that seems to be no longer maintained. 

Tested in Visual Studio 2012, using OpenFrameworks v0.8.3. 

Questions, comments and suggestions are welcome!
